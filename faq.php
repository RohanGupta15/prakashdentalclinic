                                A. Bleeding after brushing or flossing can be unsettling. It can also be a sign of an otherwise mostly silent disease — periodontal disease.
                                Periodontal disease or gum disease is a leading cause of tooth loss. It is a build-up of bacteria from plaque and tartar that can inflame or infect gum and bone.
                                <br /><br />
                                Periodontal disease causes deep pockets to form in tissue between the gums and teeth. This sometimes gives the appearance of puffy or receding gums.
                                During dental exams we routinely examine your gums.
                                There are a number of treatments for bleeding gums and periodontal disease, including removing plaque and tartar below the gum line.
                                <br /><br />
                                These treatments performed in a dental office are called scaling and root planing. They allow the gum to heal and become healthy again.
                                We recommend daily brushing and flossing as well as regular checkups and cleanings to help prevent periodontal disease.

                                Q.3 Fillings: silver or white, what is the difference?

                                A. Many of us who grew up before the time of fluoridated water have a mouth full of silver fillings.
                                These fillings known as amalgams have proven to be extremely durable restorations
                                but they are not very aesthetically pleasing.<br /><br />
                                Fortunately, recent advances in dental materials have made it possible to use tooth
                                coloured filling materials. These materials can be virtually indistinguishable
                                from natural teeth and are used to achieve long lasting and attractive restorations. In our practice, we use tooth coloured materials for almost all of the fillings that we place. Additionally, we use these materials to replace old amalgam fillings that have
                                started to deteriorate or that detract from the appearance of our patient&#8217;s smiles.

                                A. Many of our patients have asked us about replacing very old crowns that have deteriorated
                                or crowns that do not blend well with their natural teeth. We will ensure that the shade is matched and
                                the crown is shaped precisely for a very natural, indistinguishable appearance that is also functional.

                                A. Dental bonding is a simple, painless and affordable procedure that has many uses including:<br />
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Repairing chipped or cracked teeth</li>
                                    <li>Closing spaces between teeth</li>
                                    <li>Reshaping teeth</li>
                                    <li>Covering badly stained teeth</li>
                                </ul>
                                Bonding involves the application of a tooth-colored resin.
                                The dentist prepares the tooth for bonding by placing a mild solution on it to roughen the surface.
                                Using a shade guide, the dentist selects a shade that closely matches your tooth and then mixes and tints the resin.
                                The resin is applied in thin layers and then hardened with a LED or Halogen light.
                                The dentist then shapes and polishes the resin to smooth it and give it a natural look.
                                <br /><br />
                                The procedure usually takes about 30-60 minutes to complete.
                                You can even get several teeth bonded in one visit.
                                No special techniques are needed to care for bonded teeth – just maintain good oral hygiene.

                                A. Having a tooth knocked out is one of the most serious dental emergencies.
                                It can be caused by accidental falls, sports-related trauma, car accidents and even by biting into hard food.
                                However, the damage can be fixed. If you act quickly, there is a good chance the tooth can be saved.
                                <br /><br />
                                Immediately contact our office when a tooth is broken or knocked out.
                                If your dentist can put the tooth back in place within an hour,
                                there is a good chance that the supporting tissues will reattach and hold the tooth in place.
                                <br /><br />
                                If you can find the tooth after the accident or injury, bring it with you when you seek medical help.
                                Pick the tooth up by the crown &#8211;
                                this is the part of the tooth that you see in the mouth – and avoid touching the root end.
                                Do not wrap the tooth in tissue, gauze or scrub the tooth, this will damage the delicate cells on the root needed to attach the tooth back to the gum.
                                Place the tooth in a cup of milk (or water, if milk is not available) to keep it moist.
                                Remember: get to a dentist as quickly as possible.
                                The chances of saving the knocked out tooth are much greater if seen within an hour.

                                Q.7 Is it important to have an oral infection treated?

                                A. Sometimes the body’s immune system will fight and heal infections on its own but often it needs some help. When it comes to oral infections such as tooth and gum infections only your dentist can make that call. This is why it is so important to have infections and abscesses examined by a dentist.<br /><br />
                                Oral infections are a serious health matter. Symptoms include tooth,
                                gum and jaw pain, lumps or pus-filled abscesses and weeping or bleeding gums.
                                Left untreated, they can affect your overall health.<br /><br />
                                Your dentist can diagnose an infection during an oral examination.
                                They will feel your gums, gently tap your teeth and take x-rays to determine the extent of the infection
                                and whether it has spread.<br /><br />
                                If your dentist feels the infection is harmful or your body is not fighting it effectively
                                they may prescribe antibiotics.
                                Your dentist will also want to treat the underlying cause of an oral infection to prevent it from reoccurring
                                in the future. Causes may include tooth decay, periodontal disease, tooth cracks and weakened fillings.
                                Do not ignore the signs of oral infection. Practice good oral hygiene on a daily basis and have your mouth and teeth examined by a dentist.

                                A. A dental crown is a custom-designed, tooth-shaped restoration that is fitted over the
                                prepared surface of a damaged tooth to recapture the appearance and function of the tooth.
                                A bridge is used to replace one or more missing teeth and is usually attached securely to the existing teeth on either side of the gap. Recent developments in dental techniques and materials have allowed dentists to provide crown and bridge restorations that are virtually indistinguishable from a person’s natural teeth in both form and function.<br /><br />
                                If you suffer from lost teeth or teeth that are badly damaged by decay or from an accident,
                                crowns or bridges may be able to repair their appearance and preserve their function.
                                <br /><br />

                                full smile reconstruction the end result in most cases is a healthy and attractive looking smile that
                                provides a greater sense of self-confidence and enjoyment of life.

                                A. Dental Implants are part of a tooth replacement treatment.
                                They are virtually indistinguishable from your natural teeth.
                                These implants are metal posts or frames usually made of titanium that are
                                surgically placed under your gums. They then fuse to the bone of your jaw and
                                act as roots. Replacement teeth called crowns that are made of porcelain are
                                then attached to the implant. They will fit securely to your gums because they
                                are held in place by bone allowing them to look and function just like natural teeth.
                                <br /><br />
                                Once the implants are in place, your dentist will typically wait a few months to
                                proceed with crowns – temporary appliances are available for you to wear while you wait.

                                A. Oral cancer is a serious but treatable disease. If detected early, oral cancer which includes tongue,
                                lip and mouth cancer have an 80 to 90% survival rate.
                                Regular dental checkups are vital in screening for and identifying oral cancers.
                                <br /><br />
                                While some people are at higher risk, oral cancer can affect anyone at any age.
                                Disease symptoms include white or red patches, lumps in the mouth or on the lips,
                                as well as loose teeth, aching jaw, difficulty swallowing, mouth sores that refuse to heal and unexplained

                                A. Well, you might be surprised to learn the extent of what really goes on
                                during your regular check-up. In addition to cleaning and polishing all the
                                visible and hidden surfaces of your teeth, we also check for many potential
                                problems. Tooth decay, oral cancer and periodontal (gum) disease are just a
                                few examples of problems that can have serious consequences if left undetected.

                                We recommend that our patients visit our office at least twice each year to
                                ensure their optimal oral health and to help avoid serious and costly problems
                                in the future. In certain cases, we may even recommend 3 or 4 visits per year
                                in order to properly treat conditions that require more regular attention.

                                A. Did you know that 25% of orthodontic patients today are adults?<br /><br />
                                Orthodontic treatment can close gaps in teeth and correct crooked, crowded or
                                protruding teeth. It greatly enhances the appearance of your smile and can also
                                address the oral health problems that result from a poor bite and crowded teeth.
                                <br /><br />
                                Standard braces are the most recognized orthodontic treatment method.
                                Braces are traditionally made of metal but can also be made from clear or tooth-coloured materials.
                                <br /><br />
                                Invisalign is a great alternative to braces. It straightens teeth more comfortably
                                and in a shorter time than braces. Invisalign uses clear, removable aligners that
                                are custom-fitted to your teeth. The treatment is usually completed in less than one year.
                                <br /><br />
                                Orthodontic treatment is not just for teens. At any stage of life you can correct
                                the alignment of your teeth and attain the smile you have always wanted.

                                A. Recent studies have shown that by the age of three a child is already at risk of having cavities
                                which can be caused by something as innocent as putting a baby to sleep with a bottle
                                of juice or milk. Along with taking our first look at your child’s oral condition this
                                first appointment is also largely focused on the parents and helping them to
                                establish a good oral hygiene program and diet for the child.
                                We believe that a child should have his or her first dental visit by the age of 3.
                                It is a little known fact that a child&#8217;s primary teeth are vital to the long-term
                                health of their permanent adult teeth. The premature loss of primary teeth as a result
                                of accidents or decay can cause serious problems including poorly spaced and
                                crooked adult teeth. As a result,
                                it is just as important to care for a child&#8217;s baby teeth as it is for the
                                adult teeth that follow.

                                A. A child&#8217;s tooth (primary teeth) begin to loosen and fall out to make
                                room for permanent teeth at about age 6.
                                <br /><br />
                                The first baby teeth to fall out are typically the two bottom front teeth
                                (lower central incisors) and the two top front teeth (upper central incisors)
                                followed by the lateral incisors, molars and canines. Molars typically fall
                                out between ages 9 and 12 and are replaced by permanent teeth by about age 13.
                                <br /><br />
                                Baby teeth usually stay in place until they are pushed out by permanent teeth.
                                If a child loses a baby tooth early as a result of tooth decay or an accident,
                                the teeth beside it might drift into the empty space. Teeth in the opposite jaw
                                might also move up or down to fill the gap. This can crowd permanent teeth and
                                cause them to come in crooked.
                                <br /><br />
                                Some children are excited to lose their baby teeth, while others are nervous
                                about this childhood milestone. If your child wants you to pull out a loose tooth,
                                grasp it firmly with a tissue or piece of gauze and remove it with a quick twist.
                                If the tooth is resistant wait a few days and try again. If you&#8217;re concerned
                                about a baby tooth that doesn&#8217;t seem to loosen sufficiently on its own,
                                check with your Dentist. He or she might recommend a wait-and-see approach or
                                an extraction in the dental office.
                                <br /><br />
                                When your child start to lose his or her baby teeth, reinforce the importance
                                of proper dental care. With proper care you can help your child&#8217;s
                                permanent teeth last a lifetime.
